    '''
    Computes Fourier transform of a 1D function defined on a grid of evenly or
    unevenly spaced points. To compute transforms of multiple sets (functions),
    the fpts array shape must be (num_xfuns, xpts.size).

    Parameters
    ----------
    frequency: list, tuple, ndarray vector
        A list of frequencies at which to compute the Fourier transform.
    xpts: np.ndarray vector
        A vector of evenly or unevenly spaced points at which the function
        values in fpts are defined.
    fpts: np.ndarray vector of 2D array
        A vector or array of function values defined at points xpts. To compute
        transforms of multiple sets (functions), the fpts array shape must be
        (num_xfuns, xpts.size).
    uneven: bool
        If True, the method assumes unevenly spaced values in xpts. Default is
        False. If set to None, the value of uneven flag is derived from
        the values in the xpts array.

    g(q) = 2*pi*int_0^inf(f(r)*J0(2*pi*q*r)*r*dr)
    Returns
    -------
    F: np.ndarray vector
        The Fourier transfor of xfun at the given frequencies. If the fpts array
        ia a vector (points of one function only) then F is a vector of size
        len(frequencies). If fpts is a 2D array of shape (N, xpts.size) then
        F is a 2D array of shape (N, len(frequencies)).
